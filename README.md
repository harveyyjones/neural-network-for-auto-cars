This Python script performs logistic regression using gradient descent to find the optimal parameters for a decision boundary line that separates two classes of data points. The decision boundary line is plotted on a scatter plot of randomly generated data points belonging to two distinct regions.

Here's a breakdown of the documentation:

Importing Libraries: The script imports necessary libraries, including NumPy for numerical computation and Matplotlib for data visualization.
Functions:
draw(x1, x2): Plots a line given the coordinates of two points.
sigmoid(score): Computes the sigmoid function, which maps any real-valued number to the range (0, 1).
calculate_error(line_parameters, points, y): Computes the cross-entropy error, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual class labels.
gradient_descent(line_parameters, points, y, alpha): Performs gradient descent to optimize the parameters of the decision boundary line.
Data Generation:
Random data points are generated for two regions using NumPy's random module.
Labels are assigned to the data points to indicate their class membership.
Plotting:
The scatter plot is created using Matplotlib, with data points from each region represented by different colors.
The gradient descent algorithm is executed to find the optimal parameters for the decision boundary line.
The resulting decision boundary line is plotted on the scatter plot.
Displaying the Plot: The plot displaying the decision boundary line and the data points is shown.
Overall, this script demonstrates how logistic regression and gradient descent can be used to classify data points belonging to different classes by finding an optimal decision boundary.
